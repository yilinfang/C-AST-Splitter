# C-AST-Splitter

The C-AST-Splitter is revised from [PROGEX](https://github.com/ghaffarian/progex) and referred to [CAST/Splitting](https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/CAST/tree/main/Splitting).

It can exact AST and split it into subtrees in a hierarchical way from C source code and export it into a dot file. The subtrees are used for downstream tasks, like Code Clone Detection and Vulnerability Detection.
